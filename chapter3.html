<h1>Stopping a Bike</h1>
<h2>Chapter 3: Awakening</h2>
<p>Pain, all I felt was pain as I gripped my head in agony.</p>
<p>My memory was empty as I tried to remember.</p>
<p>The impact I could not remember, only the moments prior.</p>
<p>I heard other people but it was faint and distant.</p>
<p>I had survived, but something was no longer the same.</p>
<p>Something had changed inside forever.</p>
